# HEIG_TWEB_2016_lab01

A repo for a lab in the TWEB course at HEIG-VD. The goal is to learn how to use heroku and github pages by creating a small app
hosted on heroku and a landing page linking to it. The user should be able to :

* See a welcome message in a nice HTML template.
* Be able to move back and forth between the landing page and the web app.
* See a consistent look&feel across the landing page and the web app.

Our landing page can be found [here](https://flagoul.github.io/HEIG_TWEB_2016_lab01/).
