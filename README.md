# git-punch

A repo for a lab in the TWEB course at HEIG-VD. The goal is to learn how to use heroku, github pages and Angular by creating a webapp
hosted on heroku and a landing page linking to it. The user should be able to :

* Visit the welcome page and be able to move back and forth between this page and the web app.
* Once on the webapp, provide some informations to see some statistics using the Github API, in the form of a chart for example.

## Our app
Our app consists on using all the commits of a given user to display the projects and the languages used the most. A punchard displays when the commits have been made.

When the user arrives on the weapp, he can see the global stats for all the users using the app. By going on the "my stats" page, he can log in with his github account and see his stats according to the commit he made, public and private repos alike.

Our landing page can be found [there](https://benjaminschubert.github.io/git-punch/).
